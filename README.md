## 🚀 Projects & Experience

Due to **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)**, I cannot disclose specific project names or client details.  
However, below is an overview of the type of projects I’ve worked on and the measurable improvements achieved through QA activities:

- Performed **functional, UI/UX, and regression testing** on multiple web and mobile platforms, helping reduce post-release defects by approximately **30%**.  
- Designed and maintained detailed **test cases**, **bug reports**, and **checklists**, ensuring consistent test coverage and traceability.  
- Participated in **Agile/Scrum** teams, contributing to sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and test result reviews — which improved testing cycle efficiency by **20%**.  
- Verified **API endpoints** and response data accuracy using **Postman**, identifying early-stage integration issues before release.  
- Conducted **exploratory testing**, detecting usability and performance bottlenecks that improved user satisfaction metrics.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **test automation** — used **Design Studio** to execute and analyze automated test runs, which helped reduce manual regression testing time by approximately **25%** and improved test repeatability.  
- Worked in **Android Studio** for mobile testing setup and debugging.  
- Utilized **ClickUp** and **Jira** for project tracking and team coordination.  
- Performed cross-browser and cross-device validation using **BrowserStack**, ensuring consistent UX across environments.

## 📚 Learning Journey

Throughout my QA journey, I have worked on various types of testing and continuously expanded my skills in:

- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** — understanding planning, design, testing, defect tracking, and closure processes.  
- **Defect Life Cycle (DLC)** — managing defects from creation to closure.  
- **Agile Methodology** — applying key principles and values such as collaboration, adaptability, and iterative delivery.  
- **Scrum Ceremonies** — participating in Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, and Retrospective meetings.  
- **Waterfall Model**, **V-Model**, **Kanban** — understanding traditional and modern project management approaches.  
- **Test Strategy** — defining scope, objectives, resources, and high-level approach to testing.  
- **Test Plan** — creating detailed plans of test activities, resources, schedules, and responsibilities.  
- **Test Summary Report** — documenting testing results, defect analysis, and coverage for stakeholders.  
- **Fundamental Principles of Testing** — including early defect detection, exhaustive testing impossibility, defect clustering, and defect prevention.  
- **Test Documentation** — writing effective test cases, checklists, and bug reports to ensure coverage and traceability.  
- **Testing Types** — performing Exploratory, Smoke, Sanity, Regression, and Acceptance testing.  
- **API Testing** — understanding API structure and JSON responses.  
- **SQL & Automation Fundamentals** — basic familiarity with SQL, Selenium, and Postman collections.  
- **Design Studio & Android Studio** — hands-on experience with testing environments and automated test execution.  
- **Continuous Improvement** — enhancing skills through QA courses, real-life projects, and certification programs.

This knowledge complements my practical experience in manual testing and collaboration with development teams to deliver high-quality software.
